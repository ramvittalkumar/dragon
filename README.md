# dragon
An erc20 token created to perform micro transactions on blockchain 

## Inspiration
We wanted to create a ERC-20 based token for micro transactions in Dapp.

## What it does
We can make invoice payments in digitrace app using the ERC-20 token.

## How we built it
We built it based on openzeppelin ERC20.sol. Deployed the contract in Kovan testnet and created liquidity pool in Uniswap for users to Swap Dragon token for Kovan-ETH

## Challenges we ran into
Setting up liquidity pool
Integrating invoice payments using Dragon into digitrace

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Completion of token creation and E2E use case implementation of token in Dapp.

## What we learned
ERC-20 based token creation, deploying contracts in testnet using Remix, adding liquidity pool in popular dex like Uniswap, integrating the created token into Dapp for real use case.

## What's next for dragon
Upgrading Dragon into more safe and secure token based on implementation of advanced Solidity design patterns.
